     *
     * life isn't quite what i thought i be
     * when i was a kid on VOiP
     * i thought when i get older
     * i'd marry her i told her
     *
     * and now i'm 26 and i work in an office
     * 9 till 5's not the best i'll be honest
     * if i could change a single thing
     * i'd make it me and not him
     *
     * but he's in your bed and i'm in your twitch chat
     * i've got the key and he's just a doormat
     *
     * cause even though he got social skills
     * that doesn't mean i can't pay the bills
     * anywhere make the most of him
     * but she's move on pretty bloody quick
     * oo-oh
     *
     * your new boyfriend is an arsehole
     * woooh
     *
     * yeah i've met jared
     * of course i've met jared
     * the one who took you away from me
     * you hit him off instantly
     * i know cause you won't stop telling me
     *
     * seen his jawline
     * i thought about how he looks like nude
     * i'm not gay though
     *
     * she's living the dream
     * oh she's living the dream
     * from back when we were seventeen
     *
     * she's living the dream
     * oh she's living the dream
     * from back when we were seventeen
     *
     * how on earth could i be saved?
     * when i'm one click away from insane
     * i just think that i deserved
     * a little bit of what i earned
     *
     * i'm not gonna make another scene
     * the one i made when i was 23
     * means not allowed in disney world
     *
     * but he's in your bed and im in your twitch chat
     * i've got the key and he's just a doormat
     *
     * cause even though he got social skills
     * that doesn't mean i can't pay the bills
     * anyway make the most of him
     * cause she moves on pretty bloody quick
     * oo-oh
     *
     * your new boyfriend is an arsehole
     *
     * think about you every time
     * how on earth can i be saved?
     * think about him a lot as well
     * maybe
     *
     * cause you're beauty and you're grace
     *
     * and i want you to notice me
     *
     * jason derulo
     * i want to smell your hair

    /** Dream Makers - Over Again
     * The sky was crying and the mirror was looking
     * i stood with silence with nothing but loneliness
     *
     * i miss the star and the dreamy night
     * the song we've always dance to

    /** Coldplay - Fix You
     * when you try your best but you don't succeed :)
     * when you get what you want but not what you need
     * when you feel so tired but you can't sleep
     * stuck in reverse
     *
     * and the tears come stream down your face
     * when you lose something you can't replace
     * when you love someone but it goes to waste
     * could it be worse?
     *
     * lights will guide you home
     * and ignite your bone
     * and i will try to fix you
     *
     * high up above or down below
     * when you to let it go
     * but if you never try you'll never know
     * just what you earned
     *
     * lights will guide you home
     * and ignite your bones
     * and i will try to fix you
     *
     * tears stream down your face
     * when you lose something you cannot replace
     * tears stream down your face
     *
     * tears stream down on your face
     * i promise you i will
     * tears stream down on your face
     *
     * lights will guide you home
     * and ignite your bones
     * and i will try to fix you
